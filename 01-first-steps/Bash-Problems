Problems

-We're running this on the target machine automatically with Ansible. With bash:
	-scp script + resources
	-ssh to remote machine; run
	-clean up

0. Hardcoded IP in mywebsite.conf
1. We want to comment out 'vim' -- it takes up too much space for our server
2. We want to run this on 1000 servers -- only our 'web' servers, though.
3. We want to add a second site, stop hardcoding everything, and re-use a single configuration file
4. We also want to set up a database server, which is logically a part of our web application, in the same 'deployment' step.
5. We want to enforce a consistent structure between scripts
